# mask_detection
Wearing Mask Detection in the challenging time of COVID-19, it is a personal project.

for the detection on webcam, change to vs = cv2.VideoCapture("0") in detector.py

Inspired by chandrikadeb7(https://github.com/chandrikadeb7/Face-Mask-Detection)
My personal project to get familiarized with MobileNetV2 (for mask detection) and Caffemodel (for face detection and localization)
